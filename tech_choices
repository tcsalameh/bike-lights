javascript (typescript) + react + electron:
  + definitely will work cross-platform
  + already have experience with typescript
  - lots of frameworks/tech mushed together
  - js ecosystem

javascript (typescript) + react-native:
  + simpler than trying to mix in electron too
  + already have experience with typescript
  - no point in this app being on mobile, unless I change hardware to allow wireless upload
  - js ecosystem

rust:
  + minimum of framework bloat
  + better managed ecosystem
  + fun/interesting language to learn
  - no experience with rust
  - multiplatform ability is questionable
  - multiplatform ability esp. questionable for gui stuff

swift:
  + minimum of framework bloat
  + well managed ecosystem
  + fun/interesting lang to learn
  - no experience with swift
  - not cross platform
  - less widely applicable for later projects
